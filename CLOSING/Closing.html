      <div class="info">
        <div class="text1">Similar Metabolic Functions</div>
        <div class="text2">Both human and mouse livers perform essential metabolic functions such as detoxification, lipid metabolism, glucose regulation, and protein synthesis. The liver is central to regulating these processes in both species, making it an ideal organ to study metabolic disorders and drug metabolism using mice.</div>

          <div class="text1">Liver Structure</div>
          <div class="text3">The structural similarities between the liver in mice and humans, including lobular architecture, hepatocyte organization, blood supply, sinusoidal structure, and bile system, make the mouse a useful model for studying liver diseases and therapies. These parallels allow scientists to apply findings from mouse liver studies to human conditions, improving understanding of liver function and disease progression in humans.</div>

        <div class="text1">Disease Similarity</div>
        <div class="text2">Mice can naturally develop diseases that are similar to human conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. In cases where the diseases do not occur naturally, researchers can genetically or chemically induce conditions in mice to mimic human diseases, allowing for detailed study and treatment development.

      <div class="info">
        <div class="text1">Physiological Similarity</div>
        <div class="text2">Many of the biological processes in mice, such as metabolism, immune responses, and cardiovascular function, are remarkably similar to those in humans. For instance, mice and humans have similar organ systems, including the liver, heart, lungs, and brain, which function in comparable ways. These similarities make mice useful for studying human diseases such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders.</div>

      <div class="text1">Vision Similarity</div>
      <div class="text3">Mice share similarities with humans in the structure and function of the visual system, including the retina, visual processing mechanisms, and responses to light that affect circadian rhythms. These similarities make mice an effective model for vision research, conducted to understand the impact of extreme conditions such as microgravity on vision. This research helps develop treatments for visual disorders in humans.</div>
